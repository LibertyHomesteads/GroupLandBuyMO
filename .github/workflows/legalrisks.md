### RTTL Group Land Buy - Southern Missouri Ozarks region 
 
#### *The purpose of this document is to document each known legal risk and explain our compliance, with citations. Afterwards, we can bring our information to aspecialized real estate and business attorney to review and assess our situation.*

## 1. Permits and Zoning  
   ### 1.1 Zoning Laws 
   * Purchase land in an area with no county-level zoning laws
   * "South-Central Missouri: Douglas, Ozark, Texas, Wright, Webster, Oregon and Shannon do not have any type of code standard, permits needed or inspections outside of any city limit." Lawrence county also does not. 
   ### 1.2 Septic Laws at State Level 
   * Determine best way to comply with septic system law at the state level. Compel all members to comply, since failure to comply by an individual can result in a large daily fine to the LLC as a whole, not just to the individual.
   * A single residence on 3 acres or more must have a septic system, but does not require a permit. For additional residences, 10 additional acres per residence is required, and 360 feet minimum distance between any points on the septic systems. Depending on share size, we will probably have to get permits. 
   * If you meet the exemption and do not have a permit, you can still be issued a notice of violation if your system is not up to code, and you will be required to get a permit.
   * Per state law, all **graywater** must go into a septic system. We should act as if code inspectors are "out to get us" and ensure close to 100% compliance with state laws regarding graywater and blackwater, since it eliminates an easy way for state authorities to harass our community.
   * Determine whether septic permit jurisdiction is county or state, using the criteria on [this page.](https://dnr.mo.gov/water/business-industry-other-entities/permits-certification-engineering-fees/wastewater/wastewater-and-septic-systems)
   ### 1.3 Lagoon  
   * [This page](www.mosmallflows.org/lagoon-treatment-system.html) lists information about lagoon construction in Missouri. It is possible that a property we purchase fails a soil permeability test for a septic system, and we must then apply for a lagoon. This would take more land area and would probably cost more, and we may have to plan for a centralized sewer pipe network for the lagoon. [More lagoon info](https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/wq402)
   * Relevant code: Missouri Department of Health Rule 19 CSR 20-3.060, Minimum Construction Standards for On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems.  
   ### 1.4. Access for Inspectors 
   * Despite our best efforts to comply with all zoning laws, we should still keep the property entirely fenced with a locked gate, and prevent any inspectors from entering without contacting the owners and making an appointment. This is to help prevent unfair harassment by state inspectors for political or religious reasons. 

## 2. EPA Guidelines 
   ### 2.1 EPA guidelines
   * Regulations regarding any centralized drinking water provision, or livestock / agriculture regulations ([read more](https://www.epa.gov/agriculture/laws-and-regulations-apply-your-agricultural-operation-farm-activity))
   ### 2.2 Drinking Water 
   * Once a drinking water system begins to serve 15 connections or 25 people, it must comply with the SWDA. ([Read more](https://www.epa.gov/compliance/safe-drinking-water-act-sdwa-compliance-monitoring))
   * *"Private, individual household wells are not regulated by EPA."*
   ### 2.3 Oil Product Storage 
   * A farm that stores more than 2,500 gallons aboveground of oil products, and *"could reasonably be expected to discharge oil to waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines, such as interstate waters, intrastate lakes, rivers, and streams"* requires an [SPCC plan](https://www.epa.gov/oil-spills-prevention-and-preparedness-regulations/spill-prevention-control-and-countermeasure-spcc). 

## 3. Missouri Corporate Farm Ownership Laws 
   * It is illegal for a corporation (for example, an LLC) to hold title to agriculturally-zoned land in Missouri, except under various circumstances that are listed in [Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 350.010 to 350.040](https://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/aglandownership/Missouri.pdf).
   * Our project would be exempt per the following:
   * Per 350.015(7), we are a pro forma corporation or association
   * Per 350.015(9), we are both: A non-agricultural corporation acquiring the land for immediate use in non-farming purposes (forming an intentional community), and a non-agricultural corporation leasing land to a family farm unit or family farm corporation (the members who live on the land). 

## 4. Unwanted LLC Members    
   * 2.1 Inheritance - a co-owner may pass away and his share of the LLC be passed on to an unknown family member. We could include a clause prohibiting entry of un-authorized heirs to the corporation's property, thus encouraging them to sell or rent if they do not receive approval to access. We can also remove voting rights for a heir unless they are approved (this is more relevant for an LLC that is managed by all members as a group, vs an LLC that has appointed member-managers.) A similar clause would be necessary in cases of asset forfeiture, to ensure that any new members do not have rights of access to the LLC's land. (Any lease agreements must also specify this.) 
   * 2.2 Asset forfeiture - due to a civil or criminal case, a judge may order an individual's share of the LLC to be transferred to a creditor. We must examine Missouri LLC law to see if protections are possible. [This website](https://elsterlaw.com/missouri-law-blog/foreclosure-sale-membershipownership-llc/) states that a recent apellate court decision in MO intepreted MO's LLC statues in a way that made it not possible for a creditor to foreclose on and force the sale of a member's LLC ownership. However, it is unclear if this applies to SMLLCs (single-member LLCs) where a court may find that there are no other members whose rights would be violated by a foreclosure or dissolution of the LLC. 

## 5. Problematic Behavior by LLC Members
   * 5.1 General disruption and correspondence fatigue caused by rogue actors, either mentally ill members or infiltrator/agent members. We must develop policies that shut down the type of disruption that these actors cause. The operating agreement must include a code of conduct.
