## Private Membership Association 

# Articles of Association 



### Notes: 
* Products or services must be listed in this doc (for example, verification and vetting services, promotional services, etc)
* Services and participation are limited to members only — and not open to the general public.
* A Private Membership Association protects our freedom of choice and association as stated in the 1st and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
* You will be asked to review and sign a Membership Agreement. Membership dues are a legal requirement to join a Private Membership Association
*  "We need to somehow convey in the outline of our society that standards are never to be lowered. That what makes this society different from all others is the fact that we, day after day, try to be the absolute best versions of ourselves for the benefit of our group and, hopefully, others. I know this might sound like a basic truism recited by kindergarteners as a "pledge" of some sort. No, this goes much deeper than that. It is the very foundation upon which our society is built and what ultimately sets us so far apart from others."
*  Members waive right to protection under any and all anti-discrimination laws, becuase freedom of association is more important
*  Include code of conduct and warning-first or mediation-first provisions
*  King can be deposed by a fairly high percent vote of members (maybe 75%) but only his council can choose his replacement
*  Email list with tier system - proposals vs votes vs announcements


# Article I. Declaration
1. This Private Association of Members hereby declare that our primary purpose is to protect and maintain our right to freedom of choice regarding the conduct of business and management of our assets by asserting our constitutional, contractual, and civil rights under the Supreme Creator, the Common Law and the Constitution of the United States of America. 
2. As Members, we affirm our belief that the Constitution of the United States guarantees all Americans, particularly Members of Private Membership Associations, the right of freedom of association, speech, contract, assembly, belief, and associated activities, and that these are among our inalienable rights.
3. We declare and assert the right to select those whom we believe can be expected to give the wisest counsel and advice regarding those matters which form the basis of this Association and to authorize those Members who are most skilled to facilitate the actual performance and delivery of such relevant skills and services as they and we deem appropriate. We assert these rights under the Federal and State Constitutions, Federal and State law, the Common Law and the statutes and regulations interpreting them.
4. We claim our freedom to choose and accept for ourselves the types of tools and services provided by RTTL that we think might best benefit us in the pursuance of our goals. We do this in order that we might achieve specific outcomes which do not in any way impinge upon the rights, safety or well-being of the Public. We reserve the right to include traditional, non-traditional or even unconventional options as our Member Facilitators choose to deliver, subject always to our own individual acceptance and approval.

7.  This Association recognizes all Members, who are in accordance with our principles and policies. Membership shall endure for the lifetime of this Association unless revoked by the RTTL high council.

## Article II. Management 

## Article III. Membership Interest and Dues 
Describe: How to apply, criteria, term, kicking out, benefits, dues, etc 
* I understand that my Membership fee, if any, entitles me to receive those benefits declared by a Trustee to be general benefits, and that any further charges have been explained to me. I also agree to pay, as levied, for those benefits that I request and receive that are declared to be special assessments, as per a posted fee schedule.
* The term of the Membership begins on the date upon which I create my Membership and continues until the dissolution of this Association. By creating my Membership and Account on the LDFA Website, I do certify, attest and warrant that I have carefully read this application for Membership and I fully understand and agree with all the provisions stated herein.

## Article IV. Services and Products    
1. Members of RTTL that provide services, products, or advice do so in the capacity of fellow Member Facilitators in a private manner and not in any public capacity. Within RTTL, no Public Doctor-Patient or Public Provider-Client relationships exist, nor do any Contractor-Client, Vendor-Client, Tenant-Landlord, Lesser-Lessee relationships or similar, unless a separate agreement is drafted between individuals or organizations specifically waiving this Article of these RTTL Articles of Association, and in that case such waiver shall only exist in that specific circumstance between those specific individuals/organizations.
2. Within RTTL, the legal status of all members is changed from that of a Public Person to that of a Private Membership Association individual. In doing so, members relinquish certain Federal and State protections and privileges, and this is done with full knowledge and consent thereof.
3. The facilitators and other providers, who are fellow Members, offer advice, products, services, and benefits that are not necessarily conventional or traditional.
4. Members will exercise their rights for their own benefit and agree to hold harmless RTTL and Members/Member Facilitators from any unintentional liability that might result from the services, products, or advice received, except from any harm that could remotely result from an instance of deliberate fraud or “a clear and present danger of substantive evil” as determined by RTTL and defined by the United States Supreme Court.
5. Since RTTL is protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, it is exempt from any action of Federal, State or Local agencies entrusted to “protect the public” as it relates to any complaints or grievances against RTTL, its physical premises or equipment, its Trustees, Member Facilitators, Members, or other associated staff or consultants. All complaints or grievances will be settled by non-judicial arbitration within RTTL.
6. Membership and private Member records kept by RTTL are strictly protected and can only be released upon written request of the subject Member.
7. Members join this private Membership Association under the United States Constitution and the Common Law as recognized within the United States of America. Members seek to help each other achieve the vision, mission, and goals of the organization as stated elsewhere in these Articles of Incorporation.
8. All member activities within RTTL are a private matter and RTTL declines to share them with any Federal or State regulatory enforcement agency, including any medical board, FDA, Medicare or Medicaid, financial regulators, EPA, FHA, HUD, or any other similar agency. Any records that have been shared with other Members remain the property of RTTL.
9. Members agree not to file malpractice, civil or criminal lawsuits against a fellow Member, unless by willful action or inaction that Member exposes another Member to a clear and present danger of substantive evil. All Association Members are exempt from the provisions of any state business regulation, medical practices regulation or any similar federal, state or local legislation.
10. No member may join the Association whose purpose is to regulate or limit the practice of any professional service of any kind.
