Membership Contract

I/We, __________________________________, for membership fee paid in hand, do hereby apply for membership in The Waldo Way, PMA, a fraternal organization. With the signing of this membership, I/we accept the offer made to become a member of The Waldo Way, PMA and have read and agree with the following Declaration of Purpose from Article I of Waldo Way, PMA’s Articles of Association:

This Association of members hereby declares that our main objective is to maintain and improve the civil rights, constitutional guarantees, and political freedom for every member and citizen of the United States of America. We believe and affirm that the Constitution of the United States is one of the best documents ever created by man, and the signers of the Declaration of Independence did so out of love for their country.

We believe that God and the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees our members free speech, petition, assembly, right to contract, and the right to gather together for the lawful purpose of advising and helping one another in assertion of our rights under the Federal and State Constitutions and Statutes. We strive to maintain and improve the civil rights, constitutional guarantees, freedom of choice in education, healthcare, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and a variety of quality foods.

It is hereby declared that we are exercising our right, our “freedom of association” as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and equivalent provisions of the various state constitutions. This means that our Association activities are restricted to the private domain only.

We declare the basic right of all of our members to select spokespersons from our number who could be expected to give wisest counsel and advice concerning the need for high quality production of food, cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products and to select from our number those members who are the most skilled to assist and facilitate the actual performance and delivery of services and products. In addition, we proclaim the freedom to choose and perform for ourselves the types of foods, services and products that we think best for achieving and maintaining optimal wellness. Further, we proclaim and reserve the right to include health options that include, but are not limited to, cutting edge modalities, products and therapies.

Mission: The Waldo Way, PMA strives for greater availability of products and services and to provide education to its members.

Our association understands that health and wellness has many dimensions and strives everyday to provide quality food products, complementary and alternative therapies including the rights of Christian beliefs. The Waldo Way, PMA also provides its members with workshops, special events, tours, consultations, cooking classes, health coaching, and other training toward the advancement of wholistic (mind, body, spirit) wellness. A symbiotic relationship exists between the services and the products that are offered by the Association.

I have freely chosen to change my legal status from a public consumer to a private member of the Association. Therefore, I accept all personal responsibilities for my own actions of consuming and/or participating in the Association, releasing the Association of all liability for doing so. I agree to hold the Trustee’s, staff, other work members and the Association harmless from any unintentional liabilities for the results of their actions, except for harm that results from instances of a clear and present danger of substantive evil as determined by the Association, as stated and defined by the United States Supreme Court.

The Trustees and members have chosen NaRisa Y. Waldo and Trenton A. Montgomery as the persons best qualified to provide services to the members of the Association and entrust them to select other qualified members to assist them in carrying out particular services for its members.

I understand that the Association is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, it is outside the jurisdiction and authority of Federal and State Agencies and Authorities concerning any and all  complaints or grievances against the Association, any Trustee(s), members or other staff persons. All rights of complaints and grievances will be waived by the member for the benefit of the Association and its members. I fully  understand that I am consuming “raw” food products. The member waives HIPAA privacy rights and complaint processes.

As a Waldo Way, PMA member, I understand that the PMA has a Member Cost Sharing Policy, and that if I am to receive products from the PMA’s livestock, then I am obligated to remit to the PMA at the time of receipt my Cost Share for such product. I also understand that the Trustees may from time to time assess a transaction fee or an annual or periodic membership fee; additional assessments may be made at any time for services or benefits rendered.  Honorary memberships may be offered and recognized. Additionally, The Board of Trustees reserves the right to waive dues for guests of Trustees and/or its members.

I agree to join the Association, a Private Membership Association under common law, whose members seek to help each other achieve better health through spiritual, mental and physical well-being.
