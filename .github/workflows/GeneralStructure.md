# Proposed Group Land Buy Format  
### Zone of research: Missouri
  
This is a suggested group land buy format with research for **Southern Missouri**, following the ideas in the **"Return to the Land"** movement. This format, if successful, could be adopted in other regions. This is not an attempt to monopolize or force a single format. There are other potential formats that could be successful, such as a development / parcelation model, or a managed economy / coop model. I hope you will provide feedback to improve this model, it is a work in progress. Others are welcome to develop and introduce their models and we can see which becomes more popular and viable. We can also do several different models in the same area to see how they work out in the long run.   
*If others feel that they can contribute research, please let me know.* 

## How does "Return To The Land" fit in?  
  
There are many options. RTTL could be an LLC or 501(c)3, acting as a "network state," that each of the affiliated property LLCs actually own a share in. They can unaffiliate any time they like via voluntary disassocation from the RTTL organization. RTTL could also be either a formal or informal organization that affiliated projects simply declare allegiance to. RTTL could publish a list of criteria that a community must satisfy in order to be considered an RTTL community. The list goes on; I'm sure you can think of some great ideas. RTTL-affiliated communities could be required to provide a small amount of annual "dues" to RTTL to cover administrative and marketing costs. 

# General Structure 

## 1. Legal Ownership Structure  
   ### 1.1 Ownership of property  
   * LLC (or similar) owns the property outright
   * *"A common reason to form an LLC is that members can circumvent the double taxation that the IRS applies to corporations. LLCs, unlike a corporation, are not required to file income tax returns. Instead, the members of the LLC will pay personal income taxes after revenue has been distributed. This qualifies an LLC as a pass-through entity."* [Read more](https://www.upcounsel.com/is-an-llc-a-business-license)
   * The federal ULLCA is used for default operating procedures when terms aren't detailed by the LLC's articles of organization or operating agreement. [Read more](https://www.upcounsel.com/how-to-remove-member-from-llc)
   * The LLC should be specified as a pro forma corporation, and the lots should be leased to the members, to comply with 350.015(7) and 350.015(9) in [Mo. Rev. Stat. §§ 350.010 to 350.040](https://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/aglandownership/Missouri.pdf)
   ### 1.2 Ownership of LLC 
   * Members can own their share of the LLC either as a person, or as an LLC/trust/etc.
   * Anonymity: Members who wish to own anonymously, may form an LLC for themselves in a state that allows for anonymous LLC ownership (such as Wyoming), then register their LLC in Missouri for a $105 fee, and use that to own the group land buy LLC. 
   * Consider prohibiting members from owning their share via an SMLLC due to the increased risk of dissolution or foreclosure by a creditor
   * The bylaws must have specific considerations for who is allowed to live on the property (register agent only) of an LLC-based member, so that a member who owns a share via an LLC cannot simply claim that gives them authorization to send whomever they want without prior approval. 
   * Forced buy-out clause if a member owns his share via an LLC but then changes the ownership of his LLC without obtaining approval of the members of the primary land-owning LLC. (effectively changing shareholders without approval, thus attempting to bypass the share transfer restrictions)
   * To change owner of a share in an LLC, it might be necessary to notify the following entities: State government, banks, IRS, (form 8832 and form 8) and other LLC members.  
   ### 1.3 Share Transfer Restrictions 
   * The primary land-owning LLC must include share transfer restrictions and buy-out options that balance the interests of exiting parties and existing members
   * The share transfer restrictions must be crafted in the style of a [Limited Equity Housing Cooperative](https://localhousingsolutions.org/housing-policy-library/limited-equity-cooperatives/), to set a fixed profit margin for initial investors selling their shares. We want people to earn a fair return but we also want to keep the land affordable for our people.  
   * See: [Mandatory Purchase of Stock By the Company or Other Shareholders](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/stock-transfer-restrictions-in-closely-held-corporations-and-llcs-limitations-on-the-transfer-of-ownership-interests)  
   * Share transfer restriction must include the option of forced owner financing / promissory note in case a sale is not approved. All members must be aware of this from the start.
   * **In conclusion:** Members need the ability to sell their land at a fair price if they wish to leave the project. However, remaining members need to be assured that only an approved buyer can join. Both of these concerns can be addressed in the LLC operating agreement. 
   ### 1.4 Risks and Legal Compliance 
   * See [Legal Risks](https://github.com/LibertyHomesteads/GroupLandBuyMO/blob/main/.github/workflows/legalrisks.md) document
   ### 1.5 Operating Agreement for LLC 
   * "It's very important for all LLC owners to draft and implement an operating agreement that takes into account the impact of a member filing bankruptcy or having a court judgment entered against him or her. For example, the LLC members may wish to include a provision in their operating agreement allowing for the expulsion of any member who files for bankruptcy; or allowing them to purchase the interest of any member who becomes subject to a charging order. A comprehensive operating agreement is particularly important for multi-member LLCs, since disputes may develop among the members."  
   * **Code of Conduct:** [This page](https://www.thebusinessdivorcelawyer.com/how-to-expel-an-llc-member/) has a lot of excellent information regarding involuntary dissociation from an LLC, where a member may be removed from decision-making activities due to a breach of contract (if there is a code of conduct in the bylaws or operating agreement) or a general "past or present conduct that makes it not “reasonably practicable” for the LLC to continue with that person as a member". It is easier to invoke this statutory clause when a member has management responsibilities rather than simply being an owner in an LLC that has appointed managers. However, a well-written operating agreement and by-laws can allow members to be removed from group discussions etc for engaging in the type of disruptive behavior that bad actors would generally use.  
   * **Our code of conduct would include** such things as: Creating correspondence fatigue, long-winded constant emails and messages with delusional complaints or compulsive lies about other members, concern-trolling, accusations of financial or power mismanagement without evidence, [purity spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purity_spiral), insisting on inclusion of values and ideologies that were not an original part of our vision and that other members do not agree with, harassment, unfounded targeting of those with management roles either as concern-trolling or as a way to obtain management of funds. 
   ### 1.6 Jurisdiction 
   * Determine which state has the best LLC laws for our purposes. However, costs are increased for an out-of-state LLC since in addition to the filing and maintenance fees, you typically have to pay fees to register to do business in your state with an out-of-state LLC.  
## 2. Permits and Zoning  
   * See [Legal Risks](https://github.com/LibertyHomesteads/GroupLandBuyMO/blob/main/.github/workflows/legalrisks.md) document
## 3. Land Use Rules (part of the LLC Operating Agreement)  
  *We should implement basic rules, with the LLC functioning as a pseudo-HOA, not to be an over-bearing Karens, but to keep life enjoyable in our neighborhood.*   
   ### 3.1. Real Nuisance Regulations  
   * There are many ways in which someone can make life miserable for their neighbors, even on a 3-4 acre lot. Burning plastic trash regularly, starting a large hog operation with unbearable stench, playing loud music into the night regularly, selling drugs on the property, etc.  
   ### 3.2. Mediation-First Enforcement  
   * Enforcement of rules should be focused on first intervention/mediation, and then monetary fine. We do not wish to fine anybody without first attempting to resolve the issue non-monetarily.    
   ### 3.3. No unnecessary or arbitrary rules  
   * There will be no unnecesary or arbitrary rules, or rules that govern activities that do not have a material/real and demonstrable effect on other residents of the property. Example: Forbidding hanging laundry on the line or living in tents.   While one could argue that lowering property value is a "real effect," we will instead base our real effect criteria on values that are more important to our community.   
## 4. Publicity
   4.1 Determine level and type of publicity desired  
   4.2 Determine "how we portray the community" 
## 5. Physical Land Layout 
   ### 5.1 Property boundary  
   * 5.1.1 The boundary shall have a narrow right-of-way for security patrols if needed
   * 5.1.2 The members shall fund, as part of their initial budget, a fence for the entire property boundary, with locking gates
   ### 5.2 Property interior  
   * 5.2.1 Interior of property shall include sufficient rights-of-way for driveway access to all lots  
   * 5.2.2 Interior of property shall be filled with homestead lots for members, surveyed and mapped with GPS  
   * 5.2.3 Members will choose a common area to be used as a central meeting point, security post, RV hookup for members to rent temporarily, etc.  
   * 5.2.4 The lot size allocated to each share shall be the total property size minus the area of all common elements (rights of way, community areas, lagoon if necessary, etc), divided by the total number of shares.  
## 6. Action Plan 
   ### 6.1 Land Purchase and Distribution 
   * Complete research and finalize structure, create detailed prospectus 
   * Gather a group together. Research and determine several possible land candidates. Make financial pledges and agree upon a general property size / price.
   * Draft LLC operating agreement and bylaws, vote on officer roles. Include vision, mission, and goals in the bylaws. 
   * Consult a business lawyer and a real estate lawyer in MO, for a professional assessment of the legal situation of our planned project. 
   * Pass a community budget, initial and yearly. 
   * Register an LLC. Deposit the funds in the LLC's bank account. Any members who at this point cannot participate, are replaced. 
   * Purchase the decided-upon land.
   * Full survey and planning. Lots are mapped and photographed.
   * Members select their lots. If two members want one lot, they enter a bidding process. Proceeds go to community budget. 
   * Permit application for septic systems
   * Widespread residency and construction may begin, provided septic system laws are complied with  
   ### 6.2 Anti-Corruption 
   * Focus on all or most funds being managed by the LLC bank account rather than individuals
   * LLC bank account must have dual signers or similar oversight 
   * All transactions are accounted for using GAAP software with annual reports sent to members
   * Adhere to operating agreeements and bylaws for formal decision making  
## 7. Community Ideals  
   ### 7.1 Community Vision  
   * 
   ### 7.2 Community Mission 
   * 
   ### 7.3 Community Goals  
   * 
   ### 7.4 Religious and Political Preferences 
   * The community must decide what its religious and political preferences are, if having such preferences as a group is necessary, and how to ensure that it is operating within the scope of the law. Please refer to [this working document](https://github.com/LibertyHomesteads/GroupLandBuyMO/blob/main/.github/workflows/religious-political-preferences.md).  
## 8. Share Categories (example names) 
  ### 8.1 Nobleman Share 
  * An original founding member of the community.
  * Earns a commission when shares are resold (also is contractually obligated to sell portions of his initial share until it reaches his desired ending share size.)
  * This member has rights to reside on his land and other community benefits.
  ### 8.2 Yeoman Share 
  * A non-founding LLC member with a share size above the residency threshold indicated in the bylaws. This member purchased a share from the Nobleman Share members. 
  * This member has rights to reside on his land and other community benefits. 
  ### 8.3 Peasant Share 
  * An LLC member with a share size below the residency threshold indicated in the bylaws. 
  * This member has no rights to reside on the land or access the property unless invited by a Yeoman or Nobleman member to that member's own property, or otherwise approved by the LLC management.
  * No land is specifically allocated to this member; there is just a section of land that is allocated to the Peasant Shares as a whole, to which they do not have residency or access rights.
  * This member has no voting power in the LLC; this is a non-voting share. 
  * This member may only receive the minimum information required by law (annual LLC financial report, etc.)
  * This member may continue buying additional Peasant Shares until they reach the Residency Threshold, at which point they are permitted to live on the land. This is an alternative to rent-to-own that provides members with more security.
  * Special "SHTF" clause: In particularly alarming societal situations, the LLC may vote as a whole to grant emergency access and residency rights to all or some Peasant Share members. This could be seen as a benefit fo Peasant Share ownership, in addition to the investment potential, or future potential of buying enough shares to reach the residency threshold. 
  ### 8.4 Universal Rules 
  * All members may sell their share provided they follow the approval procedures established in the LLC operating agreement and/or bylaws. 
  * All members may only participate in management decisions if they have been elected to the LLC management according to the processes established in the bylaws.
  * Only Nobleman and Yeoman members have voting rights in the LLC for decisions that pertain to all members and not just the LLC management (for example, normal board elections). Their voting power corresponds to their share size. 
  * Nobleman and Yeoman members who acquire additional ownership interest from a Peasant Share as part of a forced buy-out may not add additional land to their current lots nor do they have access/residency rights for the land that the Peasant Share is tied to. They will be considered as having a both a Nobleman or Yeoman share and a Peasant Share, with rights in accordance to those share types for each specific share and land allotment.
  * Nobleman and Yeoman members who each acquire small portions of a split-up Nobleman or Yeoman share that underwent a buyout by other LLC members, jointly control the land alloted to that share. In the case that a Nobleman or Yeoman share is reduced via partial buyout or share dilution to an amount that changes its share class to Peasant, the LLC managers shall determine if the bought-out member can be granted occupancy rights as a special exception, and if so, what value the member should pay to the members who acquired part of his-her share to compensate them for the land use. 
## 9. Common Elements 
  ##### This refers to elements of the property that are commonly funded and managed by the LLC.  
  ## 9.1 Community Hub area 
  * Well (drinking water could in the future be piped to different lots, to avoid individual well costs) - Check [EPA requirements](https://www.epa.gov/agriculture/laws-and-regulations-apply-your-agricultural-operation-farm-activity) for systems larger than 25 people or 15 connections
  * Septic tank and bathroom / shower facility  
  * Grid electric connection or solar system w/ backup generator  
  * Small workshop / pavilion structure 
  * RV hookup for members to rent while visiting or developing  
  * Driveways for interior access  
  * Property perimeter fence and entrance gate  
  * Property perimeter path  
  * Administrative and IT infrastructure  
  * Community office  (could be a construction trailer office)
## 10. Documents Needed 
  ### 10.1 Articles of Incorporation: 
  * *"Articles of organization is a document that acts as a formal application to legally establish the existence of your LLC in your state and sets forth the primary details about your new enterprise. Filed as a single doc with the Secretary of State's Office (or similar state organization that handles business registration), the articles of organization describe the basic working traits of the LLC. As soon as the document is filed and accepted by the state, the articles of organization legally create the LLC as a registered business entity in that state."* [Read more](https://www.upcounsel.com/articles-of-organization)  
  ### 10.2 LLC Operating Agreement: 
  * *"The core elements of an LLC operating agreement include provisions relating to equity structure (contributions, capital accounts, allocations of profits, losses and distributions), administration, voting, limitation on liability and indemnification, books or recordings, anti-dilution protections, if any, restrictions on transfer, buyouts, dissolution and liquidation, confidentiality and restrictive agreements, both general provisions similar as govt law or dispute solution."* [Read more](https://canadianhunterwhisky.com/terms-of-llc-operating-agreement)
  ### 10.3 Term Sheet or Memorandum of Understanding:  
  * This is needed after the LLC is formed and we want to sell shares. This is a short document that specifies the basic components of the purchase deal. It confirms the parties’ intentions and serves as a blueprint for a more formal contract.
  ### 10.3 Purchase Agreement 
  * *This is needed after the LLC is formed and we want to sell shares. When you have agreed on the major points of the transaction, it is time to memorialize the deal in a purchase agreement. A purchase agreement is a formal legal document that will encompass everything from the purchase price to what you are purchasing to your remedies if something goes wrong. Both you and the seller will sign the purchase agreement.* ([Read more](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-buy-an-llc#4-the-term-sheet-or-memorandum-of-understanding))

## 11. Reporting 
  ### 11.1 Amendment to or Restatement of Articles of Organization 
  * [Missouri form LLC12](https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Business/llc12.pdf?v=2)
  ### 11.2 Amendment to an LLC registered agent, principal office, or mailing address 
  * If an LLC wishes to change its registered agent, it cannot do so with an amendment form. Applicants also cannot change an LLC's principal office or mailing address in this manner. They must submit a [Statement of Change of Registered Agent and/or Registered Office By a Foreign or Domestic For-Profit or Nonprofit Corporation or a Limited Liability Company](https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Business/corp59.pdf) form to the secretary of state by fax, mail or in person. Both have a $10 fee for processing. 
  * Missouri does not require the LLC Operating Agreement to be filed with the state, it is an internal document only: [Read more](https://www.sos.mo.gov/business/outreach/startup_guide#llc)
  * [Missouri LLC forms](https://www.sos.mo.gov/business/corporations/forms.asp#llc)
  * Missouri requires nearly everything to go in the operating agreement, and the articles of organization are just a form? [see here](https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Business/llc1.pdf?v=2)
  * Need to register with IRS. Determine if there is a need to register with Missouri department of internal revenue?
  * [MO Section 347.051 Delivery of documents to secretary of state, format, duties.](https://law.justia.com/codes/missouri/2019/title-xxiii/chapter-347/section-347-051/): *"Upon the return by the secretary of any articles, notices, documents or judicial decree of amendment marked "Filed", the person or persons executing such documents shall promptly deliver or mail a copy thereof to each member unless the operating agreement provides otherwise."*
  *  **IRS**: When the EIN is issued in the name of the LLC, the IRS will require the information of a Responsible Party of the LLC. The IRS defines the Responsible Party as “the person who has a level of control over, or entitlement to, the funds or assets in the entity that, as a practical matter, enables the individual, directly or indirectly, to control, manage or direct the entity and the disposition of its funds and assets.” If the member leaving the LLC is listed as the Responsible Party, the IRS must be informed by the LLC’s filing of the Form 8822-B and a new Responsible Party must be named. The IRS mandates the Form 8822-B is filed within 60 days of the membership change.
