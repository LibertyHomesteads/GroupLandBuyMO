###General Structure 

1. Legal Ownership Structure  
   1.1 LLC (or similar) owns the property outright  
   1.2 Co-owners can own their share of the LLC either as a person, or as an LLC/trust/etc  
   1.3 The primary land-owning LLC must include share transfer restrictions that are both fair to exiting parties and protective of existing owners  
   1.4 Risks:  
    * 1.4.1 Inheritance - a co-owner may pass away and his share of the LLC be passed on to an unknown family member  
    * 1.4.2 Asset forfeiture - due to a civil or criminal case, a judge may order an individual's share of the LLC to be transferred to a creditor. We must examine Missouri LLC law to see if protections are possible.  
3. Permits and Zoning  
   2.1 Purchase land in an area with no county-level zoning laws  
   2.2 Determine best way to comply with septic system law at the state level  
5. Land Use Contract (pseudo-HOA)  
   5.1. There are many ways in which someone can make life miserable for their neighbors, even on a 3-4 acre lot. Burning plastic trash regularly, starting a large hog operation with unbearable stench, playing loud music into the night, selling drugs on the property, etc.  
   5.2. We should implement either a private contract between owners, or an act of the LLC, functioning as a pseudo-HOA, not to be over-bearing Karens, but to keep life enjoyable in our neighborhood.    
   5.3. Enforcement of rules should be focused on first intervention/mediation, and then monetary fine. We do not wish to fine anybody without first attempting to resolve the issue non-monetarily.    
   5.4. There will be no unnecesary or arbitrary rules, or rules that govern activities that do not have a material/real and demonstrable effect on other residents of the property. Example: Forbidding hanging laundry on the line or living in tents.   While one could argue that lowering property value is a "real effect," we will instead base our real effect criteria on values that are more important to our community.
