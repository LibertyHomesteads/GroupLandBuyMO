# General Structure 

## 1. Legal Ownership Structure  
   ### 1.1 Ownership of property  
   * LLC (or similar) owns the property outright  
   ### 1.2 Ownership of LLC 
   * Members can own their share of the LLC either as a person, or as an LLC/trust/etc
   * Consider prohibiting members from owning their share via an SMLLC due to the increased risk of dissolution or foreclosure by a creditor
   * Forced buy-out clause if a member owns his share via an LLC but then changes the ownership of his LLC without obtaining approval of the members of the primary land-owning LLC. (effectively changing shareholders without approval, thus attempting to bypass the share transfer restrictions) 
   ### 1.3 Share Transfer Restrictions 
   * The primary land-owning LLC must include share transfer restrictions and buy-out options that balance the interests of exiting parties and existing members
   * The right of first refusal must be crafted in the style of a [Limited Equity Housing Cooperative](https://localhousingsolutions.org/housing-policy-library/limited-equity-cooperatives/), to set a fixed profit margin for initial investors selling their shares. We want people to earn a fair return but we also want to keep the land affordable.  
   ### 1.4 Risks    
   * 1.4.1 Inheritance - a co-owner may pass away and his share of the LLC be passed on to an unknown family member. We could include a clause prohibiting entry of un-authorized heirs to the corporation's property, thus encouraging them to sell or rent if they do not receive approval to access. 
   * 1.4.2 Asset forfeiture - due to a civil or criminal case, a judge may order an individual's share of the LLC to be transferred to a creditor. We must examine Missouri LLC law to see if protections are possible. [This website](https://elsterlaw.com/missouri-law-blog/foreclosure-sale-membershipownership-llc/) states that a recent apellate court decision in MO intepreted MO's LLC statues in a way that made it not possible for a creditor to foreclose on and force the sale of a member's LLC ownership. However, it is unclear if this applies to SMLLCs (single-member LLCs) where a court may find that there are no other members whose rights would be violated by a foreclosure or dissolution of the LLC. 
   * 1.4.3 Fine from State Health Department for septic violations - see 2.2 below.
   * 1.4.4 Unanticipated necesity for a lagoon, depending on septic test results. This would affect costs, permitting, and usable land area. See 2.2 below. 
   * 1.4.5 General disruption and correspondence fatigue caused by rogue actors, either mentally ill members or infiltrator/agent members. We must develop policies that shut down the type of disruption that these actors cause. The bylaws may include a code of conduct. 
   ### 1.5 Operating Agreement for LLC 
   * "It's very important for all LLC owners to draft and implement an operating agreement that takes into account the impact of a member filing bankruptcy or having a court judgment entered against him or her. For example, the LLC members may wish to include a provision in their operating agreement allowing for the expulsion of any member who files for bankruptcy; or allowing them to purchase the interest of any member who becomes subject to a charging order. A comprehensive operating agreement is particularly important for multi-member LLCs, since disputes may develop among the members."  
   ### 1.6 Jurisdiction 
   * Determine which state has the best LLC laws for our purposes. However, costs are increased for an out-of-state LLC since in addition to the filing and maintenance fees, you typically have to pay fees to register to do business in your state with an out-of-state LLC.  
## 2. Permits and Zoning  
   ### 2.1 Zoning Laws 
   * Purchase land in an area with no county-level zoning laws  
   ### 2.2 Septic Laws at State Level 
   * Determine best way to comply with septic system law at the state level. Compel all members to comply, since failure to comply by an individual can result in a large daily fine to the LLC as a whole, not just to the individual.
   * A single residence on 3 acres or more must have a septic system, but does not require a permit. For additional residences, 10 additional acres per residence is required, and 360 feet minimum distance between any points on the septic systems. Depending on share size, we will probably have to get permits. 
   * If you meet the exemption and do not have a permit, you can still be issued a notice of violation if your system is not up to code, and you will be required to get a permit.
   * Per state law, all graywater must go into a septic system. We should act as if code inspectors are "out to get us" and ensure close to 100% compliance with state laws regarding graywater and blackwater, since it eliminates an easy way for state authorities to harass our community.
   * Determine whether septic permit jurisdiction is county or state, using the criteria on [this page.](https://dnr.mo.gov/water/business-industry-other-entities/permits-certification-engineering-fees/wastewater/wastewater-and-septic-systems)
   ### 2.3 Lagoon  
   * [This page](www.mosmallflows.org/lagoon-treatment-system.html) lists information about lagoon construction in Missouri. It is possible that a property we purchase fails a soil permeability test for a septic system, and we must then apply for a lagoon. This would take more land area and would probably cost more, and we may have to plan for a centralized sewer pipe network for the lagoon. [More lagoon info](https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/wq402)
   * Relevant code: Missouri Department of Health Rule 19 CSR 20-3.060, Minimum Construction Standards for On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems.  
   ### 2.3. Access for Inspectors 
   * Despite our best efforts to comply with all zoning laws, we should still keep the property entirely fenced with a locked gate, and prevent any inspectors from entering without contacting the owners and making an appointment. This is to help prevent unfair harassment by state inspectors for political or religious reasons. 
## 3. Land Use Contract (pseudo-HOA)  
   ### 3.1. Real Nuisance Regulations  
   * There are many ways in which someone can make life miserable for their neighbors, even on a 3-4 acre lot. Burning plastic trash regularly, starting a large hog operation with unbearable stench, playing loud music into the night regularly, selling drugs on the property, etc.  
   ### 3.2. Private Contract  
   * We should implement either a private contract between members, or an act of the LLC, functioning as a pseudo-HOA, not to be over-bearing Karens, but to keep life enjoyable in our neighborhood.    
   ### 3.3. Mediation-First Enforcement  
   * Enforcement of rules should be focused on first intervention/mediation, and then monetary fine. We do not wish to fine anybody without first attempting to resolve the issue non-monetarily.    
   ### 3.4. No unnecessary or arbitrary rules  
   * There will be no unnecesary or arbitrary rules, or rules that govern activities that do not have a material/real and demonstrable effect on other residents of the property. Example: Forbidding hanging laundry on the line or living in tents.   While one could argue that lowering property value is a "real effect," we will instead base our real effect criteria on values that are more important to our community.   
## 4. Publicity
   4.1 Determine level and type of publicity desired  
   4.2 Determine "how we portray the community" 
## 5. Physical Land Layout 
   ### 5.1 Property boundary  
   * 5.1.1 The boundary shall have a narrow right-of-way for security patrols if needed
   * 5.1.2 The members shall fund, as part of their initial budget, a fence for the entire property boundary, with locking gates
   ### 5.2 Property interior  
   * 5.2.1 Interior of property shall include sufficient rights-of-way for driveway access to all lots  
   * 5.2.2 Interior of property shall be filled with homestead lots for members, surveyed and mapped with GPS  
   * 5.2.3 Members will choose a common area to be used as a central meeting point, security post, etc.  
   * 5.2.4 The lot size allocated to each share shall be the total property size minus the area of all common elements (rights of way, community areas, lagoon if necessary, etc), divided by the total number of shares.  
## 6. Action Plan 
   ### 6.1 Land Purchase and Distribution 
   * Complete research and finalize structure, create detailed prospectus 
   * Gather a group together. Make financial pledges and agree upon a general property size / price. 
   * Research and determine several possible land candidates.
   * Pass a community budget, initial and yearly. 
   * Pass community bylaws. Include vision, mission, and goals. 
   * Register an LLC. Deposit the funds in the LLC's bank account. Any members who at this point cannot participate, are replaced. 
   * Purchase the decided-upon land.
   * Full survey and planning. Lots are mapped and photographed.
   * Members select their lots. If two members want one lot, they enter a bidding process. Proceeds go to community budget. 
   * Permit application for septic systems
   * Widespread residency and construction may begin, provided septic system laws are complied with  
## 7. Community Ideals  
   ### 7.1 Community Vision  
   * 
   ### 7.2 Community Mission 
   * 
   ### 7.3 Community Goals  
   * 
   ### 7.4 Religious preferences  
   * Determine religious preferences of members. Determine whether stating religious preferences in official documents or advertising material violates any state or federal discrimination laws. Determine whether any potential members have a strong preference towards prohibiting certain religions or ideologies. Determine a general strategy for addressing the question of religion in relation to the community.  
   ### 7.5 Political and philosophical preferences  
   * No anarchists
   * No nihilists
