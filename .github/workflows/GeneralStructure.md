### General Structure 

1. Legal Ownership Structure  
   1.1 LLC (or similar) owns the property outright  
   1.2 Co-owners can own their share of the LLC either as a person, or as an LLC/trust/etc  
   1.3 The primary land-owning LLC must include share transfer restrictions that are both fair to exiting parties and protective of existing owners  
   1.4 Risks:  
    * 1.4.1 Inheritance - a co-owner may pass away and his share of the LLC be passed on to an unknown family member  
    * 1.4.2 Asset forfeiture - due to a civil or criminal case, a judge may order an individual's share of the LLC to be transferred to a creditor. We must examine Missouri LLC law to see if protections are possible. This website (https://elsterlaw.com/missouri-law-blog/foreclosure-sale-membershipownership-llc/) states that a recent apellate court decision in MO intepreted MO's LLC statues in a way that made it not possible for a creditor to foreclose on and force the sale of a member's LLC ownership.  
   1.5 Operating Agreement for LLC: "It's very important for all LLC owners to draft and implement an operating agreement that takes into account the impact of a member filing bankruptcy or having a court judgment entered against him or her. For example, the LLC members may wish to include a provision in their operating agreement allowing for the expulsion of any member who files for bankruptcy; or allowing them to purchase the interest of any member who becomes subject to a charging order. A comprehensive operating agreement is particularly important for multi-member LLCs, since disputes may develop among the members."  
   1.6 Jurisdiction: Determine which state has the best LLC laws for our purposes. However, costs are increased for an out-of-state LLC since in addition to the filing and maintenance fees, you typically have to pay fees to do business in your state with an out-of-state LLC.  
3. Permits and Zoning  
   2.1 Purchase land in an area with no county-level zoning laws  
   2.2 Determine best way to comply with septic system law at the state level  
5. Land Use Contract (pseudo-HOA)  
   5.1. There are many ways in which someone can make life miserable for their neighbors, even on a 3-4 acre lot. Burning plastic trash regularly, starting a large hog operation with unbearable stench, playing loud music into the night regularly, selling drugs on the property, etc.  
   5.2. We should implement either a private contract between owners, or an act of the LLC, functioning as a pseudo-HOA, not to be over-bearing Karens, but to keep life enjoyable in our neighborhood.    
   5.3. Enforcement of rules should be focused on first intervention/mediation, and then monetary fine. We do not wish to fine anybody without first attempting to resolve the issue non-monetarily.    
   5.4. There will be no unnecesary or arbitrary rules, or rules that govern activities that do not have a material/real and demonstrable effect on other residents of the property. Example: Forbidding hanging laundry on the line or living in tents.   While one could argue that lowering property value is a "real effect," we will instead base our real effect criteria on values that are more important to our community.
