###General Structure 

1. Legal Ownership Structure  
   1.1 LLC (or similar) owns the property outright  
   1.2 Co-owners can own their share of the LLC either as a person, or as an LLC/trust/etc  
   1.3 The primary land-owning LLC must include share transfer restrictions that are both fair to exiting parties and protective of existing owners  
   1.4 Risks:  
  * 1.4.1 Inheritance - a co-owner may pass away and his share of the LLC be passed on to an unknown family member  
  * 1.4.2 Asset forfeiture - due to a civil or criminal case, a judge may order an individual's share of the LLC to be transferred to a creditor. We must examine Missouri LLC law to see if protections are possible.  
3. Permits and Zoning  
   2.1 Purchase land in an area with no county-level zoning laws  
   2.2 Determine best way to comply with septic system law at the state level  
5. Land Use Contract (pseudo-HOA)
