Each class has a colloquial label, however in this Operating Agreement they shall be referred to as a Class for official purposes and to follow convention. 
2. Class A and B members have rights to reside on their allocated land and other community benefits. Class C members do not have residency or access rights.
3. Class C members may purchase additional shares until they reach the Residency Threshold of [XX%], at which point they are permitted to live on the land.

5. Anyone who is a member or a non-member can be assigned as a manager, in which case their voting rights take on those as described in Article 1, superceding the limitations described in this Article.
6. Class C members have no right to participate in official group decision making and discussion processes, unless they have been elected or assigned to the board of managers. 
7. Other restrictions or benefits of different member interests are discussed elsewhere in this Operating Agreement.
8. A member who is found to have lied or misrepresented themselves in a way that would have otherwise made them ineligible to join the LLC under the criteria of the board of managers, may be expelled from the LLC with a forced buy-out, at the discretion of the board of managers.  

### **Article IV: Common Elements and Contributions**  
1. **Common elements:** The LLC shall establish common elements for the benefit of all members, including a community hub area with well, septic system, electric connection, workshop, RV hookup, driveways, perimeter fence, and administrative infrastructure.  
2. **Other common expenses:** The LLC will be responsible for other common expenses such as property taxes, administration costs, and legal costs.   
3. **Contributions:** The common interests will be funded by contributions from members according to their percent of ownership interest.  
4. **Financial Obligation:** All members are financially responsible to contribute what is necessary, according to their ownership interest, to maintain the perfect operation of common elements, pay property taxes, meet all legal and administrative requirements of ongoing operations of the LLC and its assets, etc.  
5. **Initial Budget and Seed Budget:** The founding members wil pass an initial development budget (IDB), and a tentative operating budget for the years after, which will be reviewed when necessary. Of the IDB, a small portion of initial costs will be identified as urgent, and referred to as the Seed Development Budget, or "SDB." So, the SDB is a part of the IDB. (For an example, we will use a land cost of $200k, IDB of $100k, and SDB of $20k.)  
6. **Total Projected Initial Investment:** The "total projected initial investment" (TPII) will be the cost of the land that is purchased as per Article VI, plus the budget expenditures in the initial development budget. (e.g. Land cost + IDB = TPII. In our previous example, $200k land + $100k IDB = $300k Total Projected Initial Investment.)  
7. **Total Seed Investment**: The "Total Seed Investment"  is equal to the land cost plus the Seed Development Budget. *(e.g. Land cost + SDB = TSI. Following our examples, $200k + $20k = $220k Total Seed Investment, which is less than the $300k TPII.)*  
8. **Founding Member Contribution:** The founding members (consisting of Class A and Class C interests) must contribute the total TSI amount. After the Class A members sell off the remaining shares to reach their Desired Ending Interest, the total amount invested in the LLC will be the TPII or Total Projected Initial Investment. *(e.g. the founding members in total must invest $220k to get the project off the ground, but after selling interest later on, the total amount raised will have been $300k.)*  
9. **Founding Ownership Interest Calculation:** A founding member (Class A or C) will have an ownership interest percentage that is equal to the amount they contribute divided by the TSI. *(e.g. someone who invests $22k when the TSI is $220k, will have an ownership interest percentage of 10% initially.)*   
10. **Gradual Sale of Class A Excess Interest:** As ownership interests are sold off, a small amount is shaved off of the ownership interest of each Class A member, until their ownership interest is equal to their Desired Ending Interest. At that point, they have no more obligation to sell any interest, per this Operating Agreement. *(e.g. The previous $22k investor has a Desired Ending Interest of 5%. Their 10% initial ownership is gradually sold off to new Class B members until it reaches 5%. $8k of that resale value is a contribution, but the remaining $7k is an interest transfer directly from the Class A member to the new Class B member and is paid to the seller, plus profit. This is because a member with a 5% interest is only obligated to contribute $15k of the TPII)*  
11. **Allocation of Funds and Rationale:** Since the Class A's initial investment went entirely towards the land and the SDB, and later Class B investors' funds will go proportionally more towards the IDB, funds received from people buying Class B shares may go mostly or partially towards funding the IDB, with a preset profit being distributed directly to the Class A members as a benefit of having contributed early. *(explained in previous example; note that any amount excess of the contribution corresponding to the Desired Ending Interest is returned to the Class A member in its entirety, plus profit.)*  
12. **Normal Interest Transfer:** If a Class A member sells any of his Desired Ending Interest that he considers to be tied to his land usage benefits, it is considered a normal transfer of ownership interest, he can sell it at any price he desires (barring the invocation of a forced-buyout at a set value) and the entirety of the funds will be sent by the buyer directly to the Class A member who is selling. It would be the same as if a Class B or Class C member sold their interest.   
13. **Total Class A Investment Amount:** In the end, the Class A member's total projected investment should end up being the following: (Land cost + IDB) * Desired Ending Interest %. *(eg. if a Class A member wants a 10% share of a $300k TPII, he should invest $30k. He will start off with roughly 13.63% ownership interest, and his share will be gradually reduced to 10%, and his contribution amount will be correct, and he will receive some profit.)*  
14. **Desired Ending Interest Limitation:** A Class A Member's Desired Ending Interest cannot be greater than his initial contribution to the LLC divided by the sum of the land cost and the initial development budget. If for some reason this ends up being the case, the Class A member must contribute more to the LLC in order to fund the IDB appropriately per the size of his Desired Ending Interest. *(e.g. a Class A member contributes $20k to a $300k TPII but wants a 10% Desired Ending Share. He will start out with an 11% share, and will earn a wee bit of profit once that 1% is sold, but will have to contribute an additional $10k to meet his contribution obligation for the IDB.)*  
15. **Limitation of Class A Contributions:** Class A Members will not be obliged to pay more than their desired ending interest's share of the TPII, in the case that not all shares are sold. In this case, the members must pass a budget allowing for contribution based on the current share size of Class B and C members, and the desired ending share size of Class A members.
16. **IDB Ratification:** The IDB must be passed unanimously by all founding members.  
17. **Future Budget Ratification:** Any future operating budget, such as the one described in numeral 15, may be passed by a 2/3 majority of all Class A and B votes, and must be done on an annual basis. To comply with MO Rev Stat § 347.099 (2019), all members who are obligated to contribute funding based on that budget must sign a contribution agreement, and if they refuse, they can be found in breach of contract and forcibly expelled from the LLC.  
18. **Contradiction:** Any clause in this article that appears to contradict another clause, or that seems mathematicaly impossible, shall not render the article nor its clauses invalid, but shall instead be substituted by all parties with a solution that is equitable and mathematically correct, and that is in line with the original intent of this article.  
19. **Asignee contributions:** An assignee who has not become a member is still liable for any obligations of his assignor to make contributions, until such time as he transfers his share to another individual or entity, or is forced to transfer his share to another individual or entity as allowed in this Operating Agreement. Even if the asignee receives no other rights or benefits for his LLC interest, he is still obligated to contribute as per his interest.  
20. **Contribution promises in writing:** To comply with MO Rev Stat § 347.099 (2019), all contributions listed above shall be detailed in this Article to be signed by all founding members, and any future operating budgets requiring contributions from members, assuming they have been properly ratified as per this Operating Agreement, shall be codified into this Article, but shall also be presented to all affected members to be signed.

8. A Class A member, if he sells his "Desired Ending Interest" that is considered as being tied to and therefore granting his land usage allocation benefits, and retains his "excess interested" that is obligated for sale under Article IV, still has the sale obligation under Article IV and will not be compensated as it is sold to fund his required IDB contribution, except in such case where his contribution is already met and additional funds are then owed to the Class A member.
9. **Effect of death or incompetence of member, assignability of interest** - If a member who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction judges the member to be incompetent to manage his or her person or property, the member's executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, or other legal representative shall not have any power the member had to give his assignee the right to become a member, and shall have none of the rights of an assignee of the member's interest. Instead, the board of managers shall select a new assignee to take on those rights until such time as the ownership interest of the deceased or incompetent is transferred to a member whom the board of directors approve. The managers via a 3/4 vote may decide to obligate the sale of the interest of the deceased or incompetent individual, with a fair price determined as already specified in this Article.  
10. **Business organization as member, dissolution and subsequent assignability of interest** - If a member is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, its legal representative or successor shall not have any power the member had to give his assignee the right to become a member and shall have none of the rights of an assignee of the member's interest. Instead, the board of managers shall select a new assignee to take on those rights until such time as the ownership interest of the former entity is transferred to a member whom the board of directors approve. The managers via a 3/4 vote may decide to obligate the sale of the interest of the former entity, with a fair price determined as already specified in this Article.
